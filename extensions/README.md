Extension packages must be located in the following paths: 
``` app/ui/extensions```, ``` your data path/tools/extensions ```.  

For builds:  
``` Program Root\extensions ```

Extensions and examples can be found [here](https://github.com/DYefremov/demoneditor-extensions). 
The possibilities of extending the API, as well as the creation and publication of the necessary extensions, can be discussed there. 

### Pull requests for extensions are not accepted here!
